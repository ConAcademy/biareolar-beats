# Biareolar Beats:
# Characterization of 40Hz Bilateral Differential Haptic Stimulation of the Areola for Gamma Entrainment

## 1. Study Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This experimental protocol aims to characterize the neurophysiological entrainment responses to bilateral differential 40Hz haptic stimulation of the areola region (*biarearol beats*), with particular focus on gamma-band entrainment effects. The study will investigate the efficacy of this method for inducing synchronized gamma oscillations and determine optimal stimulation parameters for potential applications in cognitive enhancement and neurological health.

### 1.2 Research Significance and Funding Rationale
40Hz gamma oscillations have received substantial attention due to their potential therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease, autism, and other neurological conditions. Research has demonstrated that 40Hz sensory stimulation can:
- Enhance microglia activation and amyloid-beta clearance
- Improve memory and cognitive function
- Promote neural synchrony disrupted in various neurological conditions
- Enhance attention and information processing

This project extends this promising research direction by exploring a novel, non-invasive delivery method with potential advantages over current visual and auditory approaches.

### 1.3 Research Questions
1. Does bilateral differential haptic stimulation of the areola effectively induce measurable 40Hz gamma entrainment?
2. How does 40Hz areolar stimulation compare to established methods (visual, auditory) of gamma entrainment?
3. Does differential 40Hz stimulation (with parameter variations between left and right sides) enhance entrainment effects compared to uniform bilateral stimulation?
4. What cognitive and physiological effects are associated with 40Hz areolar entrainment?

## 2. Study Design

### 2.1 Study Type
A controlled, crossover design with participants experiencing multiple 40Hz stimulation conditions in randomized order, with appropriate washout periods between sessions.

### 2.2 Sample Size and Power Analysis
Based on previous 40Hz entrainment studies, we anticipate a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.6). With α = 0.05 and power (1-β) = 0.9, a sample size of 36 participants is required. Accounting for potential dropouts (20%), we will recruit 45 participants (22-23 participants of each biological sex).
